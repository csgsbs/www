The CSGSBS runs a Matrix server for instant messaging amongst CS grad students. You can register at: [riot.turing.casa/#/register](https://riot.turing.casa/#/register). To register, you will have to use your `@cs.toronto.edu` email address. Some people reported difficulties with the verification email. Be sure to check your junk mail.

You will create a username and password at registration. After login, you will also be prompted to create an encryption password which is used for end-to-end encryption in your direct conversations.

The CSGSBS rooms are hosted on our `turing.casa` server, so your Matrix address will be of the form: `@username:turing.casa`. Once you are online, you should see the following CSGSBS rooms:

- `#csgsbschatter:turing.casa`
- `#csgsbsresearch:turing.casa`
- `#csgsbsannouncements:turing.casa`
- `#csgsbstechsupport:turing.casa`

The turing.casa server is part of the wider federation of Matrix servers, so your address will allow you to communicate with users on other servers as well.

## Login Option 1 - Web Browser

Go to [riot.turing.casa](https://riot.turing.casa) in your web browser to access to the Element web app (previously known as Riot).

## Login Option 2 - iPhone or Android

The following web page has the links to app Element for iPhone and Android: [matrix.org/clients](https://matrix.org/clients). Once you have installed and opened Element, you will enter your login credentials. At login, you will also have to specify our Matrix server which is: [matrix.turing.casa](https://matrix.turing.casa).

## Login Option 3 - Desktop clients

It is possible to run the Element web-app as a desktop app, and there are a number of other desktop clients as well. You can find all of them here: [matrix.org/clients](https://matrix.org/clients). Again, when using these clients, you will have to specify the URL of our homeserver, namely: [matrix.turing.casa](https://matrix.turing.casa).
