# Invitation (Dec 7, 2022)

Hello everyone,

Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way...it is time to celebrate the end of the school year! CSGSBS will be holding a club event to visit the Christmas Market.

## When

**Wednesday afternoon, December 21, 2022**. We will gather at the Bahen Center for Information Technology (BCIT), at the lounge area on the fifth floor at 2:00 p.m., then we will go together. We will provide you with TTC two-way tickets as we plan on taking public transit.

## Where

The Distillery Historic District: 55 Mill St, Toronto, ON, M5A 3C4

The Distillery Winter Village, a.k.a Toronto Christmas Market, is on the east side of downtown Toronto near the bay front. It is about a 30-minute TTC from Bahen.

## What can you expect from the Christmas Market?

I would say mostly the Christmas vibe. Walking down the street along with your friends/classmates/labmates/someone you did not know, and enjoying all the Christmas decorations, the giant Christmas tree designed by Dior, and Christmas songs. For a list of attractions, you can check it here: https://www.thedistillerywintervillage.com/Attractions

Also food from all over the world including Venezuela Pies, Mexican Churros, Colombian Paisa-Style Empanadas, Atlantic Lobster, Ukrainian Varenyky, Pretzels, Swiss Raclette, Polpette (stuffed meatballs), Grilled Cheese, Frites, Crepes, Fine Teas, Cookies, Doughnuts, Pastel de Nata, Japanese-Style Karaage Chicken, Reuben and Pulled Pork Sandwiches, etc. You can check it here: https://www.thedistillerydistrict.com/dining/

## Our gift to you

To make sure you can get there, weâ€™ll provide your transit fares. And your first food/drink item at the Christmas market is on us (up to $15 for you and $10 for your guest).
