Hi all,

We are holding a general meeting for the Computer Science Graduate Students' Benevolent Society (CSGSBS) on Tuesday, September 27th at noon. The meeting will be in BA 3200. A Zoom link will also be provided for those who can't attend in person. It will last for about an hour, and lunch will be provided (vegan options included). At this meeting, we will hold elections -- more on those below!

### What is CSGSBS?

CSGSBS is both a social group and a course union for graduate students in the Computer Science department. Our social events include Cookie Break (a weekly informal get-together on Fridays where a volunteer brings cookies or other snacks), board game nights, and end-of-semester pub nights. We also represent the graduate students of the department on committees: we elect representatives to the university-wide Graduate Student Union, to CUPE 3902, and to the DCS Graduate Affairs Committee.

Please see our website for more information: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/csgsbs/

## Election

We will be holding elections for all positions, which include:

- President
- Treasurer
- Social Coordinators
- Representatives to the aforementioned committees
- Pop masters (responsible for stocking pop fridges in Bahen and Sandford Fleming)
- Webmaster

#### Call to action

If you're interested in running for any of these positions, please let me know by emailing me! This is a great way to get involved with the department. Regardless of whether or not you intend to run, please try to attend this meeting.

If you plan to join us in person, please email me with an RSVP so that we can get enough food for everyone.

I hope everyone is having a productive start to their year!

Morgan Shirley (he/him) - President, CSGSBS
