You may have heard of the effort started by Claas Voelcker and Silvia Sell√°n to increase the minimum departmental graduate student funding. At their request, I will be creating a CSGSBS Standing Committee for Better Graduate Funding, which will integrate their efforts and will serve to regularly meet with the Department Chair and exert pressure on the departmental leadership to follow through with their commitment to increase our funding. If you want to join this committee, please contact me (csgsbs-president@cs.toronto.edu)! If you want to stay up to date with the actions of the committee, subscribe to their mailing list: https://groups.google.com/g/living-wage-cs-uoft/
