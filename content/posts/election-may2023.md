### What is CSGSBS?

CSGSBS is both a social group and a course union for graduate students in the Computer Science department. Our social events include Cookie Break (a weekly informal get-together on Fridays where a volunteer brings cookies or other snacks), board game nights, and end-of-semester pub nights. We also represent the graduate students of the department on committees: we elect representatives to the university-wide Graduate Student Union, to CUPE 3902, and to the DCS Graduate Affairs Committee.
