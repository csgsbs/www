Do you need a break? Come join us for our weekly cookie breaks! Chat with your peers, play board games, and have some light refreshments.
We usually send out notifications through the graduate cs mailing list and on Discord. 

## Fall 2024

Cookie breaks are continuing! If you have any suggestions of a place you'd like to try snack from, please fill out this [form](https://forms.gle/P41pYG12n4EUznba9). We will be hosting cookie breaks on the 7th floor of Bahen (BA 7231) at 3:30-4:30 pm every Friday. 


## Spring Summer 2024

This semester we are trying something new! CSGS presents the Cookie Break series: **Eating around the World (read Toronto)**. We bring you snacks from countries around the world created by our local multicultural community. Please join us Fridays at 3:30-4:30 pm for a fun treat :)
