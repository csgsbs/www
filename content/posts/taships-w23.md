Main round TA applications have now opened for Computer Science!

- St. George (due Nov 23): https://tapp2.cs.toronto.edu/#/public/postings/Vsyn66PZdXiWjtH9K7oaYUdG
- Scarborough CS, Math, Stats (due Nov 7):  https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/webapps/cupehiring/dept/cms/app/ta

We are also investigating TA hiring practices in a few departments at the University of Toronto. I would greatly appreciate it if you filled out our (optionally anonymous) survey, especially if you aren't a TA but would like to be. It would be most helpful if responses are received by November 18, 2022, but we still welcome responses after! https://forms.gle/2n12xmeXudaf3Jn28

And, as usual, if you have other concerns, please fill out the (optionally anonymous) form we circulated a few weeks ago. https://forms.gle/3uusgC1V6dRN8BQMA
