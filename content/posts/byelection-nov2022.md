_Congratulations to Shirley Wang, our new CUPE 3920 Representative!_

---

As we didn't elect a Representative to [CUPE 3902](https://www.cupe3902.org/) at our [last general meeting](../gm-sept2022), we will be holding a by-election this month. Some of our current initiatives and actions make filling this position crucial in adequately representing and supporting our students to CUPE 3902 and in teaching contract issues.

We don't currently have any [Master of Science in Applied Computing (MScAC)](https://mscac.utoronto.ca/) students on our council and our mailing list still doesn't include them. Therefore, I'll appoint a MScAC Liaison as a program representative as well as a messenger for future announcements. For now the role will be temporary and non-voting (a constitutional amendment is required otherwise). Naturally, only MScAC students are eligible.

If you're interested in either position, please review the [constitution](../../constitution.pdf) and contact me at [csgsbs-president@](mailto:csgsbs-president@cs.toronto.edu) by **9PM on Tuesday, November 8, 2022**.

Robert (Rupert) Wu | President, CSGSBS
