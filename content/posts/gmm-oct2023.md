On **October 13, 2023 at 1PM**, we will hold our first general membership meeting (GMM). The rough agenda items include introduction to CSGSBS, a vote on a new constitution, and general election.

- The GMM will take place in **BA 7231** (Bahen Centre).
- We will video conference on Zoom for students unable to attend physically.
- For those of you attending in-person, lunch will be provided!

While not required, we would appreciate if you complete **[this form](https://forms.gle/G4xFKgG2hfeqWSqHA)** for feedback and catering purposes.

## A New Constitution?

We have drafted a new constitution and are seeking feedback and ultimate approval from the general membership. Please have a look at the before-and-after and propose any amendments ahead of the GMM.

- Current: <https://www.cs.toronto.edu/csgsbs/constitution.pdf>
- Proposed: <https://www.cs.toronto.edu/csgsbs/constitution-2023-10-02.pdf>

Ideally, we will make appropriate amendments to the draft before it is presented at the GMM. However, during the meeting we will hold a Q&A session and accept further amendments on the draft before voting on it as a whole.

**[feedback form (same as above)](https://forms.gle/G4xFKgG2hfeqWSqHA)**

## Nominations for the General Election

Joining the CSGSBS council is a great way to make a difference, serve your fellow graduate students, and meet new people. If you're interested, please have a look at both versions of the Constitution. Candidates may run for multiple positions, except for both President+Vice-President or President+Treasurer.

This election is somewhat unusual as it will take place immediately after the vote on a new constitution. Up until the candidates' introductions (after the vote on the constitution) during the GMM, we welcome self-nominations. Most of the roles and duties remain unchanged, but should the new constitution be rejected,

- Candidates for Vice-President may choose to withdraw or instead stand for President.\*
- The Liaison for Applied Computing Students will be appointed and non-voting.\*\*
